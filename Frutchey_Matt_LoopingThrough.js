// 1. Write a for loop that will traverse through an array of numbers, and print each number.
/*var arr1 = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9];
for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
    console.log(arr1[i])
} */

// 2. Write a for loop that will traverse through an array of numbers, and print the sum of the number and the index of the number in the array.
/* let sum = 0
var arr2 = [4, 7, 13, 13, 19, 37, -2];
for (i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++){
    sum = sum + arr2[i]
    console.log(`The sum is ${sum}.`)
    console.log(`The index in the array is ${i}.`)
} */

// 3. Write a for loop that will traverse through an array of numbers, and print ONLY the numbers greater than 5.
/* var arr3 = [6, 2, 12, 14, -24, 5, 0];
for (let i = 0; i < arr3.length; i++){
    if (arr3[i] > 5){
        console.log(arr3[i])
    } else {
        arr3[i] = "No dice."
        // console.log(arr3)
    }
} */

// NINJA BONUS: Modify your solution for #3 so that any numbers in the array that are NOT greater than 5 are instead replaced with a string of "No dice." This string should NOT be printed.
